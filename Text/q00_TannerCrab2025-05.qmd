# Introduction 

The next full assessment for the Pribilof Islands blue king crab (PIBKC) stock will be reviewed by the Crab Plan Team (CPT) in September 2025 and the NPFMC's Science and Statistical Committee (SSC) in October 2025. The stock has been on a two-year cycle for assessment and the last full assessment was conducted in September 2023 [@PIBKC2023]. Following the September 2025 assessment, the stock will begin a four-year assessment cycle and the next full assessment will be conducted in 2029. 

This report primarily addresses a number of issues related to data from the NMFS EBS bottom trawl survey for PIBKC that have arisen since the last assessment. First, AFSC's Shellfish Assessment Program (SAP) has developed an R package, "crabpack", as a replacement to AKFIN Answers (https://akfin.psmfc.org) for obtaining crab-related survey data in a standard format. SAP requested that assessment authors test the package and compare results of data pulls using the package with data pulled using the authors' previous methods. Second, as part of the effort to "modernize" the NMFS EBS bottom trawl survey to improve efficiency, the high-density "corner" stations in the NMFS EBS survey grid near the Pribilof Islands and St. Matthew Island were dropped for the 2024 survey and will not be sampled in future surveys. Assessment authors were asked to consider the impact of this change on their assessment. Finally, the 2023 and 2024 surveys found no mature male blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands sampling strata. While this is principally a consequence of applying relatively low sampling effort to a stock at low (but non-zero) abundance, the "hard zeros" introduced in the time series of mature male biomass for PIBKC can be problematic for the subsequent assessment. Several approaches to dealing with this issue are considered here. 

This report is organized into the following sections: Responses to previus CPT and SSC Comments (@sec-Resps), "New" Data and Analyses (@sec-NDAs), Summary (@sec-Smry), and Acknowledgments (@sec-Acks).

<!-- # Responses to CPT and SSC Comments {#sec-Resps} -->

```

<!-- # "New" Data and Analyses {#sec-NDAs} -->
```{r sct_NDAs, child=file.path(child_path$peek(),"q02_NewDataAndAnalyses.qmd")}

```{r sct_NDAs, child=file.path(child_path$peek(),"q03_AssessmentModelExplorations.qmd")}
```

# Summary {#sec-Smry}

The author recommends  

The author recommends using the full-precision carapace length measurements with the current length-weight regressions to calculate biomass from NMFS EBS survey abundance and size data.

The author looks forward to discussions with the CPT and SSC regarding model choices for the September assessment and further refinements to address on a longer timescale.

# Acknowledgments {#sec-Acks}
